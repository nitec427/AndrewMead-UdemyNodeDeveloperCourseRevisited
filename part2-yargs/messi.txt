According to L'Equipe, the Ligue 1 champions have made 700 million euros in revenue, a record since Qatar Sports Investments took ownership of the club in 2011.

Part of this is down to sponsorship, which saw an increase of 13 percent thanks to the contracts reached with GOAT (50 million euros for the season), Crypto and Gorillas, which will bring in an additional 10m euros. PSG will earn more than 300 million from advertising, which is a new record for the club.

Messi has had a major impact on the club's accounts, with PSG selling more than one million shirts, 60 percent of which bore the number and name of the Argentinian star.
